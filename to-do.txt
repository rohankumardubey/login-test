 - There should probably on server be a giant hashmap of user IDs corresponding to filenames, or
 whatever the secure version of something like that is. That way someone can't finagle their way
 into somebody's data just by looking for their username +.json, and the cookie can then also just
 store an integer instead of a username. Of course, using a real database would also help with that,
 but hey, I like json, it's easy and super convenient for small projects
